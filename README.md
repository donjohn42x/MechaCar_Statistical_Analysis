Based on the results of the regression analysis on the 5 variables in relation to MPG, we can determine which factors contribute to MPG at a given significance level. If we choose a level of significance of 0.05, then we can coclude that vehicle length, vehicle length, and ground clearance contribute to the MPG on a car (Based on the p-values shown in the analysis)

Based on the output of these tables, we can see that the data may meet the design specifications for all manufacturing lots in total, but does not meet design specifications for each indivdual lot given that the specifications dictacte that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100. Looking at the table containing the statistics the entire dataset, we can see that the variance is 62.29, but if we are to look at the table with the individual lots we can then see that lot3 has a variance of 170.29.
